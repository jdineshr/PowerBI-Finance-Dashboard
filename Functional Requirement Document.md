# 📊 Problem Statement – Bank Loan Data Analysis Dashboard

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze bank loan data and generate actionable insights related to loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower profiles.

The dashboard aims to support data-driven decision-making for improving loan approval strategies, risk management, and overall financial performance.
